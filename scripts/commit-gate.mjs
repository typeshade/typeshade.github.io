// The fast checks from CI, before a Claude Code commit. `.claude/settings.json` registers this
// as a PreToolUse hook on Bash: it reads the tool call on stdin and does nothing unless the call
// is a `git commit`. Then it runs the checks below side by side (about ten seconds, check-copy
// being the slowest) and blocks the commit (exit 2, the report goes to the agent) while one
// fails. Each of them otherwise shows up in CI, one failed build at a time. Astro itself, the
// guide and API checks and the qa passes over dist/ stay in `bun run build` and after it, which
// are run before pushing (README.md, Checks).
