// src/lib/example-pages.ts found the first stage declaration on. The file's own text is
// untouched, and scrolling up from there reads the header the way opening the file does.

// axis: a fade at its trailing edge while the four tabs are wider than the pane, which is
// the phone layout and the widths where the card splits inside a narrow column. The flag is
// measured here and not written into the stylesheet, because the width the tabs want is the
// file name's, and that is different on every example page.
