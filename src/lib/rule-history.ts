// repository's own history of the vendor/shader-dsl pointer, and the rules at each one from the
// compiler's reqs/rules at that commit. A rule is added or removed when its item appears or goes
// away, and changed when Doorstop's fingerprint of it (`reviewed`, over the rule's text and its
// verifying files) moved. Nothing here is typed by hand, and a history the build cannot read
// stops the build: an empty list would say that nothing changed.
