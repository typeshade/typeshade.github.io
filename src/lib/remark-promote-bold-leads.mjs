// A few sections of AUTHORING.md use a bold run as a pseudo-heading instead of real Markdown
// syntax: a paragraph that is nothing but "**Label**", or a paragraph or list item that opens
// with "**Label**" and continues in the same block ("**Label.** rest of the sentence" or
// "- **Label** ... rest of the sentence"). Real headings drive both the rendered outline
// (Docs.astro reads them from Astro's own heading collection) and the "On this page" panel, so
// a section written this way renders with neither. This runs only on a section with no real
// heading of its own, and turns exactly that convention into one; a paragraph or list item that
// opens some other way is left as it is.
//
// Runs on AUTHORING.md itself and on a translation under content/guide/<locale>/, the only two
// places a guide section's body comes from (the same test src/lib/remark-api-links.mjs uses). A
// translation that keeps the bold-lead convention needs the same treatment, or its page would
// carry no heading at all where the English one does.
